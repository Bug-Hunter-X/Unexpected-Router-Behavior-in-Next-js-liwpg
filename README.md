# Next.js Router Issue: Unexpected Navigation Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue encountered when using the Next.js `router.push()` method.  The issue manifests as unexpected behavior or errors when navigating between pages, particularly those involving dynamic routes or server-side rendering.

## Problem Description

The problem occurs when calling `router.push()` from a page component, especially when navigating to a page that might have differing data requirements on the client-side compared to the server-side.  The behavior might include incorrect page rendering, unexpected redirects, or even runtime errors.

## Code Example

The `about.js` file contains a button that, when clicked, uses `router.push()` to navigate back to the home page (`/`).  Under certain conditions (e.g., dynamic routes or server-side data fetching), this navigation might not work as expected.

## Solution

The provided solution offers strategies to mitigate this issue, including checking for the router's status, using `router.replace()` for seamless transitions, or implementing alternative navigation methods depending on the complexity of the application's routing logic.
